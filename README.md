# BrainFlix
BrainFlix is a full-stack React App built with an Express backend. Users can click through a set of videos, view their meta information, and view the comments for that video. Photos are used in lieu of videos, as the main exercise of the project was to manage state and connect to your backend with read routes.

## Project Prompt
You have been approached by an entrepreneur to build out a prototype for a new video streaming platform called BrainFlix. The entrepreneur has meetings lined up for funding with several VCs and needs the prototype built within the next three weeks. BrainFlixâ€™s Creative Director has provided you with a package and mockup of how they envision the final product. There is also a separate team that is currently working on a backend API needed to integrate with the front-end, but for the time being the static function components need to be put together. It will be your job to create a functioning and responsive app prototype from the project designs provided.
